# Silence

Rain blurred the edges of Nova’s neon glow, turning the streets into rivers of color that flickered and bled across cracked pavement. Cold slid over him, close as breath, but his steps never slowed.

Broken advertisements flickered against darkened storefronts, neon promises dripping down windows in streaks of grime, slipping lower with every flicker. Holographic faces stared blankly into the night, their perfect features fractured by walls sinking under rust. Beneath his hood, Silon felt the familiar tug of scar tissue, rough against his skin. Warmth flashed in his mind—a pulse slipping through his fingers, faint and fading. The memory shivered just beneath the scar.

He kept moving. The city wore its rot like a second skin, close and clinging as his own. Iron and earth, the smell of it brushed the edge of his senses, a ghost he’d carried for years. He trembled once. The word “monster” echoed as he pulled his hood lower, and he could almost feel the blade press into his own skin, marking him as he’d marked that night into memory, close as bone.

Silon climbed the fire escape of a building long surrendered to ruin, his boots near-silent on the rain-slicked metal. Below him, engines murmured into the hum of rain against concrete. His target tonight was a politician who wore the city’s misery like a cloak, speaking of progress while deepening its decay. Each step was measured, part of a ritual he had perfected over time.

On the top floor, he slipped through a window he had personally left ajar. The air thickened around him, stale perfume and cigar smoke masking a sour undertone that caught in his throat. The scent clung to the walls, heavy and stale. Silon’s breath slowed, his fingers flexing around the handle of his blade, the scent sharpening his focus. Warmth brushed his fingertips, faint—a pulse slipping through him from somewhere distant. He flexed his grip until it vanished.

The politician lay sprawled in bed, his breaths deep, oblivious to the figure beside him. Silon’s hand moved without hesitation, the blade slipping into his palm, its edge angled and ready. He knelt, adjusting with precision, the blade hovering over skin. A shallow warmth pooled against his hand, a pulse from some far-off memory. His grip stuttered. A heartbeat of stillness. The silence deepened as if it could settle into his skin. Then he steadied, the weight of the past pressing close.

The blade pushed forward. Flesh yielded in silence. A stillness settled, broken only by a final sound, too faint to reach beyond the dark. Silon’s hand moved as if on its own, wiping the blade clean, though something in his motions felt fractured. The numbness didn’t return as quickly as it should have. He rose, crossing to the window to gaze out at the rain-soaked city below.

The neon lights stretched and blurred, streaking the streets with fractured color. Tonight, the usual hum didn’t fill his mind. Instead, the silence pressed in as he looked at his reflection, distorted by the rain. Scars caught in the dim light, twisting his face until it hovered there, half-there, swallowed by the city’s glow. The cold pressed closer, sharper as warmth slipped away, but the weight remained, heavier than the scars he wore.

Rain traced lines down the window, slipping over his scars, blurring the lines of his face into the night, dissolving until only shadow remained. His reflection faded into the city’s lights, slipping away like a memory. Warmth touched his hand again, faint, echoing under the rain.

He closed his eyes, the rain pressing close, its rhythm steady, refusing to fade.
