# The Notes You Don't Play

Morning light slipped through the blinds, filling the edges of a pristine room. Shelves stood neatly ordered, surfaces gleaming, each object in its place, waiting.

A dragonborn lay in bed, one hand splayed over a folded blanket. His eyes opened slowly, catching the first touch of dawn. He rose with practiced ease, fingertips brushing the edge of the nightstand as he passed, a silent greeting to the room and the day.

In the kitchen, he lifted his hand, claws spreading wide over a silver kettle. His palm hovered above it, and the kettle rose, drifting to the burner. With a flick of his wrist, the flame appeared beneath, steady and blue. Steam curled to life, winding from the spout as he watched, his eyes tracing each twisting tendril.

As the tea steeped, he let his hand rest on a worn book at the counter’s edge, the cover softened from years of use. He turned a single page, its edge creased from familiar touch. His thumb lingered there, a faint smile tracing his lips, though his gaze remained distant. Beside him, a porcelain cup settled with a soft chime, and he took it in hand, the warmth spreading through his fingers as he brought it to his lips.

He paused, holding the cup near his face, letting the steam drift against his skin. For a moment, he simply stood, the silence around him full and breathless, as though the morning itself were waiting with him.

Setting the cup down, he crossed into the studio, a small, white-walled room beyond. The violin rested against the far wall, its dark wood polished and familiar. He paused, fingertips brushing the strings as if greeting an old friend. Lifting it with care, he felt the weight settle into his hands, balanced and familiar. He inhaled slowly, closing his eyes for a single, held breath.

Then, with a steady hand, he drew the bow across the strings. A soft note floated into the air, stretching long and unbroken, filling the room, reaching into each quiet corner. His fingers moved with ease, each note building upon the last, creating a gentle crescendo. Light drifted from his fingertips, thin tendrils winding through the air in time with the music, weaving through the notes like threads spun from sound itself.

The room filled with his playing, each movement of the bow tracing patterns of color in the air, arcs that pulsed with each rise and fall of his wrist. Sound pressed against the walls, filling the room to its edges, his final notes lingering, then tapering to silence. The light faded, falling to dust as it settled around him, leaving only the quiet.

He lowered the violin, running a claw along its polished edge, his eyes tracing the curve of its frame one last time. He held it close for a breath, feeling the memory settle into the quiet, before placing it gently back on its stand.

Taking one last look around, his gaze lingered on each shelf, each familiar corner of the room. At the doorway, he paused, letting his hand rest against the frame as though leaving a parting touch. With a small, reverent motion, he flicked the light switch, casting the room back into shadow, letting silence settle as though it had never been broken.

Without a sound, he left. Light shifted through the blinds as he stepped through the doorway, his figure dissolving into the morning, leaving behind only the quiet memory of his song.
