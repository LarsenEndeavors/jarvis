# Not Black and White

## Not Black and White
Nova stretched endlessly into the dark, neon lights casting a slick glow over its damp streets. The rain whispered, tapping a relentless rhythm against metal and stone, a pulse that matched the steady thrum of the city’s heart. Above it all, New Nova hovered, the floating city’s spires gleaming with arcane brilliance, a beacon of what was possible and what was lost. From below, it looked like a promise half-fulfilled, or maybe just a lie too well-dressed to be questioned.

Rhyne walked the streets below, her boots barely making a sound as they hit the pavement. She was just one of millions, but the weight of her thoughts threatened to drown her. She pulled her coat tighter, the fabric slick with rain. This was her city, but today, it felt like a stranger. The people moved around her, fast, disconnected, caught in the grind of Nova's machine. She slipped between them, unnoticed, unseen. A ghost among the living.

Her mind wandered back to the lab—\*again\*. The experiment had been an echo she couldn't escape, a thread she kept pulling, hoping it would unravel into some kind of understanding. It hadn’t. Instead, it had left her with questions she couldn't yet answer.

_\*The Tiefling.\*_ The one she'd taken control of. The one she'd failed. She had tried to help, had reached for something better, something more, but in the end, her actions had fractured that world. Rhyne could still feel the weight of it, like blood on her hands. The experiment wasn’t supposed to be real—but it was. It always was.

And now, here she was, wandering these streets, trying to reconcile the two halves of herself: the scholar who chased knowledge, and the woman learning the limits of control.

The sky above cracked with lightning, briefly illuminating New Nova’s floating towers, their silhouettes stark against the dark clouds. Power hummed through the air, not just in the city’s infrastructure but in the invisible lines of will that shaped magic itself. Rhyne had always been drawn to those lines—seen them in the corners of her vision, like the edges of a forgotten melody, waiting to be remembered. That’s why she’d taken the experiment, why she’d let herself merge with the Tiefling, why she always reached for more. _To understand._

But understanding came with a price.

Her thoughts twisted around themselves like the smoke that curled from a hundred chimneys, and with every step, the tension grew. The rain wasn’t enough to wash away what she carried. Apathy whispered in her ear—its cold logic telling her to stop caring, to stop wanting. She could let go. She could just fade into the city, disappear into the rain, and let Nova take her.

But Love burned hotter. It pulsed in her veins, refusing to let her surrender. She knew what it was to stand alone, to stand strong—even when the world felt like it was crushing her, even when her own failures were the heaviest weight to bear. She knew what it was to be self-reliant, to get knocked down and rise again. And Love reminded her that there was something worth rising for, even if everything else had fallen apart.

Rhyne’s eyes tracked a shadow that darted past, and her hand instinctively moved to the holster at her waist, the weight of her sidearm a comfort. She’d outfitted it with an arcane core last month, a decision that had seemed smart at the time but now felt more like a patch for a wound she didn’t want to admit was festering. The alley ahead of her was dark—\*too dark\*. She stepped into it anyway, her footfalls quieter now, her senses alive to the possibilities.

A figure emerged from the gloom, all shifting outlines and jagged edges, a thing born of magic and shadow, unbound by any known form. Its body moved like liquid, each limb stretching and retracting in unnatural motions. This was what she had come to expect from Nova’s underbelly—creatures made of broken will, magic twisted by the city’s relentless hunger.

It didn’t speak, but Rhyne felt it. A pull. A resonance, deep inside her, where the goddesses had begun to stir. Apathy told her to step back, to let the shadows take her. It would be easy, wouldn’t it? Just slip into the dark, let it close over her, let the world forget.

But Love flared, a hot ember in her chest. She couldn’t fade—not now. Not ever.

Her hand flexed over the grip of her weapon, and with a flick of her wrist, a glyph formed in the air before her, its edges crackling with power. Magic was more than just words or energy—it was will, and hers was iron. The figure paused, hesitating just long enough for Rhyne to step forward, pressing her advantage. Her voice hummed with the resonance of old songs, melodies she’d learned in the quiet hours between the grind of city life, and with each note, the magic tightened around her like a shield.

The creature lunged, and she was ready, the glyph expanding, growing brighter as it caught the force of the attack and held firm. The impact knocked her back, but she held her ground, her body thrumming with the power she was just beginning to understand. The goddesses whispered louder now—Apathy still cold, still logical, but Love’s fire was undeniable. It drove her forward.

“Not today,” she muttered under her breath, her voice barely audible over the rain. The creature shifted again, but Rhyne’s hand moved faster, tracing another glyph in the air, this one sharper, deadlier. A blast of force shot from her fingers, slamming into the creature and sending it sprawling into the shadows.

It wasn’t dead. It wouldn’t die. But it was gone, for now.

Rhyne stood there for a long moment, breathing hard, the rain dripping from her hair and pooling at her feet. She felt the weight of the city pressing down on her—the mistakes, the failures, the endless grind of trying to be something more in a world that didn’t care.

And yet.

She wiped the rain from her face and holstered her weapon. She wasn’t done yet. There were still questions to answer, still things to learn. The experiment with the Tiefling might have been a failure, but that didn’t mean she was. There was more here, more to find, more to \*understand\*. The goddesses’ voices still warred within her, but she was starting to think that maybe they weren’t enemies. Maybe they were both part of the same truth.

She glanced up, past the rooftops and toward the floating spires of New Nova, the city’s magical core gleaming like a star that was always just out of reach. She had chased that star for as long as she could remember, but now, she wasn’t sure she needed to catch it. Maybe it was enough to stand here, grounded, between the shadows and the light, and let both guide her.

Everything was fucked. The world was chaos, and the city didn’t care if she lived or died. But she had this power—new, raw, still forming—and it was hers. That was enough.

Rhyne turned her back on the shadows and started walking, the sound of her boots a steady rhythm against the wet pavement. The city breathed around her, alive, indifferent. But she was here, and she had the will to shape it.

Maybe that was all she needed.

_For now..._
