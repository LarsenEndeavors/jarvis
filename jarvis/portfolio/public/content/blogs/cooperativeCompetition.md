# How to Win D&D

> What's up Gang and welcome to Fen1x Rising, a blog for DMs, GMs, and players mostly through the guise of Fifth Edition Dungeons & Dragons.  I'm Fenix, a forever DM with over 12 years experience running games in settings from one-on-one to massive multi-room tables.

## Why I love TTRPGs

TTRPGs are a fabulous way to make friends, learn about yourselves, and others.  They allow us to tell unique stories collaboratively, giving us tools and rules to use and break which seems to give adults and children alike the ability to riff freely, escaping the insanity of simply babbling "What ifs" over and over again.

## Why I love D&D

My family has always gamed together, my parents and I sat in a bedroom playing Morrowind, making mods, hex editing save games. In 2014 WotC released the D&D 5e starter kit, my father bought the kit, we all sat down and started playing.  I picked up the pre-made wizard, my wife was the fighter, and my mom was the cleric.  By the end of Lost Mines of Phandelver, or what we thought was the end, I had a sentient Jade Frog named Jimmy.  I remember collecting the jade frog from the loot you get in the first goblin cave.  My wizard was fascinated with the jade statuette and began calling it Jimmy.  I would talk to it, made jokes with it, and pretended it was my familiar.  Later in that campaign we found the soul forge, and Jimmy was sacrificed on the forge, again so I thought, but instead of smashing it became a permanent familiar.  In that moment my love for the game was sealed.  I picked up the DMG, PHB, and Monster Manual the minute they were released and tore into them voraciously.  It wasn't long before I had a group of 8 people at my own table and I never looked back.

## Collaborative Storytelling

D&D, Powered by the Apocalypse, FATE, Pathfinder, Call of Cthulu, and most other TTRPGs are based around the concept of collaborative storytelling.  They embrace the essence of "Yes, and", but where improv comedy is looking for the next laugh, TTRPGs allow us to tell immersive, often wild and off-the-rails stories.

There are very few video games where Tony the Tiger could legitimately run a magic jewelry shop called "Frosted Flakes", or the Fruit Stripes Zebra could end up being the BBEG, but in TTRPGs that is the essence of the game.

## Cooperative Competition

Today I want to discuss an oft-missed point of D&D that I call Cooperative Competition.  In chess, often times a checkmate comes out of nowhere. The feeling you get when you realize you're screwed, or that you've just won, is the same feeling my players and I get when, seemingly out of nowhere, some plan goes astray.  Often times DMs who prep massive binders of campaign notes will have to throw out 75% of their notes because their players realized that the environments are destructible, and simply remove a keystone from the evil wizard's 20-story tower and it all comes plummeting down, turning a 4-hour session into a 15 minute joke.

My players' have a saying: D&D is a game, you win when the DM yells "Fuck you!"

I'll be honest, they win a lot.

I have an addiction to agency.  I believe that if a character could, they should be able to, regardless of documentation.  I think it's much more interesting to live in the world and play in the space after the tower comes crumbling down, rather than coming up with some bullshit reasoning explaining the bricks of the tower were magically sealed with super-mortar and stamp my foot, insisting they go through my intricately crafted dungeon.  This makes it a lot harder to run a game sometimes, I admit. The reward, however is a group of players that buy into the *story* more than the *game*.  The goal of a TTRPG is to tell a story, when the rules get in the way of that, the story suffers and everyone has less fun.

So what do I mean by Cooperative Competition?  Well, as the DM, my "job" is to be the system, and arbitrate the rules. My job is to process the actions of the players and explain how their actions interact with the world.  If I allow the rules to be broken, it can lead to serious imbalance, and honestly playing too loose with the rules can impact the fun just as much as holding them close to the chest.  The players, however, do not give a rat's ass about the rules.  They have a sheet in front of them with a list of ways they can manipulate, bend, or break the default rules of the game.  Most of the time players **are not thinking about the rules of the game**. They're fantasizing what their characters would do in that moment, they're not worried about how a round represents 6 seconds of time, they're thinking "I have a crowbar, that would open that door."

This tension is the heart of the Cooperative Competition.  As a Dungeon Master, I know the rules that the crowbar bends, but as a person, I know that the rules may not completely encompass all the creative uses for that crowbar, sure maybe there's a rule for opening a door with it, maybe not.  What if the player wants to jam that crowbar into an electronic panel in an effort to hack the panel or shut off the device it controls?  Do I let them?

**Hell yes.**

Why?  Because it's **fuckin' cool**.  Who cares, why look it up?  Why stop the flow, why staunch their creativity?  Why not allow it and keep rolling?  My precious dungeons, my story, the notes I wrote before hand can all still be easily used later, maybe they're skipping 3 hours of content, fine! It's stuff like this that makes me break into a huge grin and say "Fuck you guys!" Because yeah, I spend hours on writing notes and making a cool story, and honestly if they find a way to speed run through it, that's a huge and hilarious win to me.  Moreover, the players feel smart, and their characters look amazing.

Embrace it, lean into it, D&D is a game, and you win when the other side of the table yells "Fuck you!"
